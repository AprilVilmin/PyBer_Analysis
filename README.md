# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project
As a new data analyst at PyBer, a ridesharing company, you are tasked with making visualizations using pandas in conjunction with matplotlib to create a line graph with multiple lines to display the variations in fares between rural, suburan and urban cities. To make this line graph you will be using fare data at the weekly level for each city type.

## Results
The results of analysis revealed that on a weekly basis between January 2019 and the end of April 2019 urban cities made the most fares. Urban cities were always above $1,5000. Whereas Suburban cities stayed between $500 and $1,500  and rural cities stayed under $500. This can be see in greater detail in the graph below.

### Total Rides
The data shows that the total number of rides in the PyBer Summary Data is higher for urban and suburban areas than it is for rural areas.

### Total Drivers
The number of drivers who drive for PyBer are greater in urban areas than suburban areas and greater in suburban areas than rural areas. 

### Total Fares
Due to the the vast difference in the number of rides and drivers between urban and rural cities the total fares is much higher for urban cities than rural cities. The total amount of fares for suburban cities is also greater than it is for rural cities.

### Average Fare per Ride
Contrary to how the Total Fares metric is higher in urban cities, the Aerage Fare per Ride metric is higher in rural communities. This makes sense as riders in rural communities are most likely going to have to travel farther between destinations on average and drivers are going to have to travel farther to pick them up.

### Average Fare per Driver
Like the Average Fare per Ride metric, the Average Fare Per Driver metric is also higher in the rural cities than it is in urban and suburban cities. 




## Summary



Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
